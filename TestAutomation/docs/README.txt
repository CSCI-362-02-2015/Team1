This is an automated testing framework designed for the OpenMRS system.  The testing framework is designed to be used in a Linux OS.  There are no precise system requirements.  The testing is done at run-time, test case by test case. 

The testing framework we created is designed to run a series of user-created tests on the OpenMRS software.  A more detailed description of the particulars of the framework is given in the Testing Framework section, however here we make mention that the testing framework functions by running a series of test cases which were written by the user.  The results of these tests are recorded and displayed in an HTML page.

The requirements of various aspects of the project are tested using test cases.  Each test case will be in its own test case file and will test only one requirement.  The filename for the test cases should be testCase#.txt, where # is replaced by the Test ID number of the particular test case.  The test cases will be in the testCases folder and should have all of the following lines in this order:	Test ID: 	the ID unique number of the test	Requirement: 	the requirement being tested in the test case	Component: 	the component being tested in the test case	Method: 	the signature of the method being tested in the test case	Inputs: 		the inputs for the test case	Expected: 	the results after the test	Driver: 		the name of the driver class without the extension	Notes: 		any notes or additional information about the test caseThe testing framework has the top-level directory of TestAutomation.  Below is a description of the various directories within the TestAutomation directory and their proper use   /scriptsThe scripts folder contains the runAllTests.sh script, as well as any other scripts necessary to the execution of the testing framework.  The runAllTests.sh script will remove the old reports from previous tests and create a new html report. Once all the test cases have been run, the script opens the html file in a browser.   /testCaseExecutablesThe testCaseExecutables folder contains all files needed to run the test cases with the runAllTests.sh script.  These will be various drivers.  Included is the CohortUnionDriver.java file, which facilitates testing the union function of the Cohort class.  It transforms the array inputs and outputs which are typed in the file into Integer arrays which can be used in java and calls the union method and sends the output of the test to the script.   /projectThe project folder contains the source code from the OpenMRS system.   /reportsThe reports folder contains an HTML file named report.html.  This file contains the Test ID, Requirement, Inputs, and Expected lines from the test case and further indicates whether or not the test was passed or failed. 	
   /docsThe docs folder contains a txt file named README.txt.  This will describe various aspects of the project and testing frameworkThe test cases are described in great detail in the following section.  Below is a representation of the testing framework./TestAutomation    /project    /src    /bin    /... /scripts    runAllTests.sh /testCases    testCase1.txt test, Case2.txt ... /testCasesExecutables  testCase1... /temp  /oracles /docs  README.txt /reports  report.html
